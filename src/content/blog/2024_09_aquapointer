[Aquapointer](https://github.com/unitaryfund/aquapointer) is an open source software package developed by the Unitary Fund team with consortium partners [Pasqal](https://www.pasqal.com/) and [Qubit Pharmaceuticals](https://www.qubit-pharmaceuticals.com/) and funding from [Wellcome Leap](https://wellcomeleap.org/).
The library is designed to be a computational tool used in pharmaceutical development, specifically for studying the placement of water molecules in protein cavities.

Proteins are complex molecules with cavities that can be occupied by water molecules, particularlly in living tissue.
The presence of water molecules influences the binding of small molecules called ligands to specific protein sites, a problem of interest in drug discovery.
Protein solvation effects can be studied either by modeling the interactions experimentally, which is generally a costly and relatively inefficient process, or by using numerical models.
Classical numerical methods, such as Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics, can give some insight but the computational complexity of these methods are too large for certain hard cases. 
An alternative approach is to find first the density distribution of water molecules, through methods such as the [3D Reference Interactive Site Model (3D-RISM)](). 
By looking at 2D slices of the 3D-RISM density function, we can define a discrete optimization problem (per slice) whose solutions correspond to positions of water molecules.

Aquapointer generates 2D slices of an input 3D-RISM density function, maps the slices to a QUBO problem, translates the QUBO to an analog pulse sequence or a digital circuit, and then calls the backend API and processes the results.
The analog workflow in Aquapointer uses [Pulser](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser) for intermediate representations (IR) of the pulse sequences and for interfacing to supported backends, e.g. QuTip
The digital workflow uses Qiskit for IR and simulated backends.

Since we first introduced Aquapointer, we have upgraded it to include 3D-RISM density processing, in the form of the `slicing` and `densitycanvas` modules.
The `slicing` module takes a 3D-RISM density file and transforms it into 2D slices along user-specified planes. 
The `densitycanvas` module contains classes and functions for transforming the 2D slices or generating them from a probability distribution and mapping the density distributions into a QUBO formulation.
