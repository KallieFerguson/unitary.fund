Aquapointer is an open source software package developed by the Unitary Fund team with consortium partners Pasqal and Qubit Pharmaceuticals, funded by Wellcome Leap.
The library is designed to be a computational tool for the drug discovery process, specifically finding the locations of water molecules in protein cavities.
Aquapointer takes density files produced from 3D-RISM simulations, maps them to a QUBO problem, translates the QUBO to a digital circuit or analog pulse sequence, calls the backend API, and processes the returned bitstrings to determine locations of water molec.
